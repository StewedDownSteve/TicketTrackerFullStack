# TicketTrackerFullStack
I took a demo ticket tracker thatt i had built with local storage(HTML, CSS, JS) and turned it into a full stack application. I rebuilt it as a CRUD app using MVC structure. It was a great journey of taking a protype and then fully fleshing it out and adding more styling!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** EJS, JavaScript, MongoDB, Express, Node, Bootstrap


## Optimizations
*Database Indexing:* Implemented proper indexing on the MongoDB database to optimize query performance. 

*Responsive Design:* Ensured a responsive design that adapts seamlessly to various device sizes.

*Asynchronous Operations:* Leveraged asynchronous operations to prevent blocking and enhance the concurrency of the application.

## Lessons Learned:
*Project Scaling:* Starting with a client-side prototype allowed for a progressive scaling of the project. The initial version served as a foundation, and the transition to a full-stack implementation was easier because of it.

*Maintaining Cross-Technology Consistency:* Ensuring consistency across different technologies (HTML, CSS, JS, MongoDB, Express.js, EJS) can be challenging but is essential for a cohesive user experience. This lesson underscores the importance of maintaining a consistent design and functionality flow, regardless of the technology stack.

*Testing & Debugging:* Emphasizing continuous testing and debugging from the early stages of development is critical. Identifying and resolving issues promptly not only ensures a smoother development process but also reduces the likelihood of encountering major challenges later on.

*Scalability & Performance:* The project's evolution underscored the importance of considering scalability and performance from the start. The shift from local storage to a full database required a  focus on optimizing and ensuring efficient data retrieval.

## How To Imrpove:
My plan is to first add a working dashboard to show the lifecycle of the ticket. 

Logging, User Authentication, Search and Filtering, Attachments, Automated Testing

## Examples:
